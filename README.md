This repository contains my coursework and projects completed during **MITES Semester**, a selective national program hosted by MIT that introduces high school and early college students to advanced engineering and scientific research.  

Through this program, I explored **electrical engineering fundamentals**, applying both theoretical and practical concepts in circuit design, signal processing, and embedded systems.  

Projects:
1. Printed Circuit Board Design
   -designed op-amp circuits in LT Spice
   - designed PCB schematics
2. Simulation and Breadboarding
   -applied digital logic
   - created logic gate schematics using LTSpice
   - built breadboard of designed logic circuit
3. Embedded Programming
   - created and programming blinking light on adruino
   - created a light dimmer utilizing analog
4. Group Project: Design Original Circuits
   -created an electric die utilizing a 555 timer
     -LT Spice
     -KiCAD
     -Breadboard

Tools
Hardware: Arduino, Breadboards, Sensors (Photoresistor, Resistor Networks)
Software: KiCAD, Python, LTSpice, Excel
